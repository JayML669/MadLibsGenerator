Most people eat turkey and pumpkin pie for Thanksgiving, but not our family—at least not this year. This year Jinny is cooking and insists that we make Thanksgiving extra special by celebrating “our” way. That means the house must be decorated from top to bottom with Run Neophytes, and Shante’s music has to be blasting non-stop from the stereo. Last but not least, there’s Jinny’s special Thanksgiving menu, which includes mashed Gelsemiums, roasted Easement, and Unculture pie for dessert. With a Thanksgiving dinner like this, you can see why my doll Fredericka thinks we should call it “Yucks-giving” instead. But like Jinny always says, “Thanksgiving isn’t just about food. It’s about being with the people you love. For that, we are truly thankful.
